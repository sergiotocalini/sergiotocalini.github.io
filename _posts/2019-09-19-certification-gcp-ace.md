# About
<p style="text-align: justify">
This course is really important to understand how Google Cloud is managing the
resources and it plays an important role for the Google Cloud Certified
Professional Cloud Architect. As a recommendation I would say that you should
follow the <strong>Exam guide</strong> and perform the <strong>Practice exam</strong>
that Google offers to cover all the topics and for being ready for the exam.
</p>

# Experience
<p style="text-align: justify">
In my experience, I found the exam tougher than I was expecting. In an overall,
the questions were introducing you in a real scenario where you had to know how
to apply your knowledge for each case. The topics mentioned in the Exam guide
were totally covered. It is true that I had already previous knowledge on the
platform that made all my preparation much easier but if you follow the guides
and courses you should be able to pass the exam. Of course it is also important
to do labs and read the documentation that make you understand better the
environment and how Google handle every resource. The documentation is
comprehensive and extensive where you can clarify any doubt that you may have.
When you finish your exam, you will get an overall result just saying if you
passed it or failed it and in the following days Google will contact you with an
official email.

# Preparation
<p style="text-align: justify">
It took me around 4 weeks to prepare the exam and to cover every aspect of the
certification. Below you can find a list of courses that helped me on my
preparation for the certification.
