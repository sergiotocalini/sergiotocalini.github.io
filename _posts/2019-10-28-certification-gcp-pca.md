# About
<p style="text-align: justify">
This certification is giving an important understanding on how Google Cloud is
providing services and how you can integrate those to provide a scalable solution
following the best practices and standards. As usual Google provide an
<strong>Exam guide</strong> and a <strong>Practice exam</strong> to cover all the
topics that are included on this certification.

# Experience

# Preparation
<p style="text-align: justify">
I think it is really important to remark that I took the Associate Cloud Engineer
exam before and it helps me a lot to prepare this exam, that is why I would also
recommend to take the courses for that certification as well.
As an overall, took me around 2-3 weeks to prepare for the Professional Cloud Architect
exam and to cover every aspect of the certification.
