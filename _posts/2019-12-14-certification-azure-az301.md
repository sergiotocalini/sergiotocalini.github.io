# Experience
<p style="text-align: justify">
When I was planning to take this exam, I was expecting to go to a Certification
Center as usual. Then I learned that I wouldn't be in town by that date, so the
only alternative I had was to take it online. As this was my first experience
using this method, I was more concerned about the connectivity I would have and
the whole process more than how I should go through it. Despite all of these, I
had a perfect experience with the platform and from now on I will prefer this
method than going to a Center. Regarding the exam itself, to be honest, it was
much easier than I was expecting, and  by far the AZ-300 was more complicated
and required more concentration. In this one, if you have enough experience with
Azure and designing architectures and solving problems you will be more than
fine going through it.

# About
<p style="text-align: justify">
The <i>AZ-301</i> certification exam gives a big overview about the services and
the Microsoft approach on how to design a solution in a cloud environment. This
exam with the <i>AZ-300</i> will certified that you are a <strong>Microsoft Azure
Solutions Architect Expert</strong>. Microsoft is making a lot of effort to make
the engineers and architects get familiar with Azure and they provide complete
documentation and guidance on how to prepare to get certified.
</p>

# Preparation
<p style="text-align: justify">
In my experience to get this exam passed, I red the official documentation provided
by Microsoft (please find the links below in the [courses](#Courses) section). It
is a really nice reading and useful to have a good understanding on how we can
prepare to take the exam. There are also some videos in Udemy that will help you
to go through all the topics quickly. The most important thing is if you have
experience with Azure and have done architectures in a cloud environment, you
definitely will be ready to take this exam.
