# Introduction
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	On June 5th 2019 took place the DevOps Expo at Credit Suisse's offices in
	Zurich. The aim of this event was to cover different aspects of DevOps 
	methodologies. It also focused on how a big company such as Credit Suisse
	can work in a more efficient way of delivering software.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	It was a pleasure to be part of this expo and have the opportunity to share
	my experiences over the years as a DevOps Architect. I've been working in several
	projects transforming business models and creating application cycles. My presentation
	was named <em><strong>"Merging Security and Enterprise DevOps: DevSecOps"</strong></em>
	and it was focused on how we should include Security on an early stage in the
	Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
</p>

# What do we get implementing DevOps methodologies?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Basically, we can reduce time and accelerate processes. At the same time,
	improve the performance and the profits. It helps to increase the frequency
	of releases so you can innovate and improve your product or service faster. This
	means, the quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can
	respond to your customers needs and build competitive advantage.
</p>

# What are the challenges?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Nowadays, IT plays an important role in every organisation by increasing the
	business benefits. Through IT we can provide innovation and agility, to achieve
	this, we need to reduce time from one cycle to another. That means, while the
	Development team is trying to deliver as fast as they can, Operations team try
	to keep the environment as more stable as they can, and on the top of these,
	Security team wants to keep as much secure as possible. That means we need to
	combine these teams efforts in a single process to make this cycle reliable.
</p>

# The Cloudy Shift (The GBU)
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	We consider that the Cloud migration and DevOps methodologies should be aligned in
	order to generate possibilities for automation. This new paradigm empowers
	developers and increases the collaboration between Development and Operations
	bringing <strong>GOOD</strong> sinergy.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	However, sometimes the Security team is involved late in this process causing
	<strong>BAD</strong> consequences and delays.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Which leads to the <strong>UGLY</strong> part where Security starts blocking
	releases and with this the agility goes down putting in risk the business goals.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	After all these, how can we avoid the issues? Start thinking that the Security
	is an important ally and needs to be engaged from the first step.
</p>

# How do we achieve a DevSecOps environment?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Bringing DevOps and Security teams together. It is more about an organizational
	change, meaning that everyone (also Managers and Heads) should include this in
	their agenda.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	There should be a mindshift in the whole DevOps team to make Security as
	priority and to understand that everyone is responsible for this. Both teams
	should share knowledge to prevent reinventing the wheel all the time.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	When we look at the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) this leads to a
	shift (of security) to the left. Instead of Security being added very late
	into the cycle we want security as early as possible so ideally also even
	in the plan and code stages
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	Integrating Security automation is an important aspect, also manual steps
	should be eliminated as much as possible to prevent human error and make
	the process more agile.
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	The Security team shall be peer reviewed when changes happen, if possible
	existing patterns/design
</p>

# Lesson Learned
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	What we learned today is that Security needs to be the first priority and
	make it part of the DNA of your DevOps practices and also that Security needs
	to be automated.
