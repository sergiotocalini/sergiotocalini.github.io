# Introduction

{:.justified}
This time Google was organised a one-day event focused on Anthos. This is a new
modern application platform that helps business to build, deploy and manage
applications anywhere.

{:.justified}
Anthos basically allows you to manage a multi-cluster kubernetes architecture
following all the Google best practices in Google Cloud Platform.

{:.justified}
This platform provides a consistent development and operation control across all
your clusters and helps to reduce the operations overhead.

# Sessions

{:.justified}
On this event, Google splitted the agenda in two main focuses, the first one was
about a General Management overview, trying to explain managers how this new
platform can help their businesses to improve their workloads and to start their
journey to Google Cloud Platform.

{:.justified}
The second main path on this agenda was for technical people, where the sessions
were focused on how Anthos actually works under the hoods and what is the problems
that it tries to solve, like Application Deployment and Service management.


# Takeaways

{:.justified}
I was pleased to be invited to this event as part of Cloudreach, an experienced
company that helps business on their journey to the Cloud, and also as a
specialist on Google Cloud Platform.

{:.justified}
On this event what I could takeaway after this event is the intention that Google
has on trying to offer a platform that can speed up some processes on these
journeys and opens a new ways to manage workloads in Kubernetes.
